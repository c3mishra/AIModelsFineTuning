## 🎮 RunPod PyTorch Template Setup Steps

### 1. 🖥️ Launch RunPod PyTorch Template Instance
- **Template**: Choose "RunPod PyTorch 2.4.0" template
- **GPU**: RTX 4090, A100, or any available GPU
- **Storage**: Minimum 25GB recommended
- **Features**: Pre-includes PyTorch 2.4.0, JupyterLab, Python environment

### 2. 📁 Upload Files
Upload the essential files to your RunPod workspace directory (`/workspace/`)

### 3. 🚀 Quick Setup (Choose One Method)

#### Method A: One-Command Setup (Recommended)
```bash
bash pytorch_template_setup.sh
```

#### Method B: Python Setup
```bash
python runpod_pytorch_setup.py
```

#### Method C: Manual Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements_pytorch_template.txt
```

### 4. 🌐 Access JupyterLab
- **JupyterLab is already running** on the PyTorch template
- Access via the RunPod web interface
- Or direct URL: `https://[your-pod-id]-8888.proxy.runpod.net`

### 5. ▶️ Run the Notebook
- Open: `chatbot_demo.ipynb` in JupyterLab
- Run all cells in order
- Training takes ~10-20 minutes on GPU
- Interactive chat interface appears at the end

## 🆘 Troubleshooting (PyTorch Template Specific)

### ❌ Common Issues

**"Package not found" errors**
- Run the setup script first: `bash pytorch_template_setup.sh`
- Template has most packages, just need AI-specific ones

**"JupyterLab not accessible"**
- JupyterLab is pre-running on the template
- Use the RunPod web interface to access it
- No need to start manually

**"CUDA out of memory" during training**
- PyTorch template optimized for GPU, but reduce batch_size if needed
- Default batch_size: 32 → try 16 or 8

**"TinyLlama loading issues"**
- Template has good GPU memory management
- Model will auto-fallback to CPU if needed
- Check internet connection for initial download

### ✅ PyTorch Template Advantages

You'll notice these benefits:
- ✅ **Faster setup** - Core packages pre-installed
- ✅ **JupyterLab ready** - No configuration needed  
- ✅ **GPU optimized** - Better memory management
- ✅ **Stable environment** - Tested package combinations
- ✅ **Better performance** - PyTorch 2.4.0 optimizations

### ✅ Success Indicators

You know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Training loss decreasing over epochs
- ✅ "TinyLlama loaded successfully" message
- ✅ Interactive chat widget appearing
- ✅ Intelligent responses to food questions
- ✅ Training plots showing convergence

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Once everything is running:

1. **💬 Test the Chat**: Use the interactive widget to ask food questions
2. **📊 Explore Analytics**: Check the prediction matrices and user analysis  
3. **🌐 Try the API**: Optionally run `python api_server.py` for web interface
4. **🔧 Customize**: Modify user profiles or add new foods in the notebook

**The notebook is completely self-contained - everything you need is in `chatbot_demo.ipynb`!**
