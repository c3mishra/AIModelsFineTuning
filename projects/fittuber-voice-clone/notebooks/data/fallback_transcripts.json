  "sample_video_0": "Welcome to FitTuber! Today we're talking about the best ways to lose belly fat naturally. The most important thing to understand is that spot reduction is a myth. You cannot target belly fat specifically, but you can reduce overall body fat through a combination of proper diet and exercise. Start with compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and push-ups. These exercises work multiple muscle groups and burn more calories.",
  "sample_video_1": "Protein intake is crucial for muscle building and fat loss. I recommend consuming 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options like lentils and quinoa. Don't forget to stay hydrated and get adequate sleep, as these factors significantly impact your fitness results.",
  "sample_video_2": "For beginners, start with bodyweight exercises three times per week. Focus on proper form rather than heavy weights. A basic routine should include push-ups, squats, planks, and lunges. Gradually increase the intensity and duration as you build strength and endurance. Consistency is more important than perfection.",
  "sample_video_3": "Intermittent fasting can be an effective tool for weight management, but it's not magic. The key is creating a sustainable calorie deficit. Popular methods include 16:8 or 14:10 fasting windows. Always listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new eating pattern.",
  "sample_video_4": "Cardio is great for heart health and calorie burning, but don't neglect strength training. A balanced approach includes both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be particularly effective for burning fat and improving fitness in less time."
